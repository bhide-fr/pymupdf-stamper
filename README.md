PDF stamper for windows. You can either stamp a single page or all the pages of the document. If you want a stamp with numbers, you need to have the number as the first three letters of your filename. The number will be printed on line #3 after the text/label you want.

## Windows
Just download and run the `pdfstamper_win0.1-en.exe` file.
